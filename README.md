# Green Test Day

This repository contains task for potential teammates joining #green team in Heureka.cz.

## Task Description

One of our colleagues in Hereka.cz created a useful tool for sharing secret information with
other people in our organization. While he was a great programmer and quite good with cryptography,
he wasn't so good with Docker.

He tried to get his application working with docker-compose, so other developers
can easily run it on their own machines, but after some time, he gave up and asked
if you could help him.

All his work so far is in this repository. Ideally all a new developer needs to do is to run `docker-compose up`
and local instance of the application starts up.
